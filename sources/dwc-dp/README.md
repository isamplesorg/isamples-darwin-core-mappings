## Transformations
[dwc-dp-tables.csv,dwc-dp-columns.csv,dwc-dp-foreign-keys.csv] generated using [https://github.com/ben-norton/dwc-dp-transformation-utils](https://github.com/ben-norton/dwc-dp-transformation-utils) from the source tableschemas located here: [https://github.com/gbif/rs.gbif.org](https://github.com/gbif/rs.gbif.org)
  
[dwc-dp-classes.csv] generated by reducing dwc-dp-tables.csv to a set of singular and mutually exclusive concepts. Relational/duplicative tables in the dwc-dp-tables.csv we re removed and four classes were added to fully account for all resources. The additions do not have corresponding tableschemas and therefore had to be created for the dwc-dp-classes.csv source file.
  
## General Equivalences  
* Tables are considered a relational representation of dwc-dp classes suitable for relational databases and data packages.
* Columns are generally equivalent to properties such that the property represents a concept and not created
for relational purposes (foriegn keys)
* Foreign keys have no equivalent in the RDF namespace. Rather they establish a relationship between two classes in
a normative relational model (relational database).
