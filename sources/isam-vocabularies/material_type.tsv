Anthropogenic metal material 	Metal that has been produced or used by humans. Samples of naturally occurring metallic material (e.g. native copper, gold nuggets) should be considered mineral material. Metallic material is material that when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires). The boundaries between metals, nonmetals, and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal, c.f. http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001069)		Anthropogenic material			https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/anthropogenicmetal
Anthropogenic material	Material produced by human activity.		Material 		Material that would not be found in nature without human intervention. Thus clay would be a Mineral material, but fired clay in a brick or ceramic would be an Anthropogenic material.   Native copper would be a Mineral, but smelted copper, extracted from ore that might include native copper (among other sulfide and oxide minerals) would be Anthropogenic metal material.	https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/anyanthropogenicmaterial
Any ice	a material that is in a solid state under the temperature and pressure conditions of the preserved sample, but is a liquid or gas at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).	The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard temperature and pressure (STP) is 20°C (68°F) and 1 atm (14.696 psi, 101.325 kPa). This standard is also known as normal temperature and pressure (NTP).	Material 		Samples of non-aqueous ice should be classified as Any ice, based on decision that distinguishing ice that might or might not be aqueous from non-aqueous ice does not merit adding another class to the scheme.	https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/anyice
Biogenic non-organic material	Material produced by an organism but not composed of very large molecules of biological origin. E.g. bone, tooth, shell, coral skeleton,	Include ash from burned biogenic material. Biogenic non-organic material is intended to cover biogenic products consisting of mineral or mineraloid substance, e.g. apatite (or other Ca phosphates), aragonite (or other Ca carbonate) typical of shells, bone, teeth.	Material 			https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/biogenicnonorganicmaterial
Dispersed media	Material that contains discrete elements of some material dispersed in a continuous fluid medium.  The dispersed component can be a gas, a liquid or a solid (based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersed_media). Does not include mixtures of granular material like soil, sediment, particulate, or solids that would be considered  rock material.

Natural Solid Material	A naturally occurring solid material that is not anthropogenic, biogenic, or ice.		Material 			https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/earthmaterial
Fluid material	Substance that continually deforms (flows) under an applied shear stress, or external force. Fluids are a phase of matter and include liquids, gases and plasmas. They are substances with zero or small shear modulus, and flow at a perceptible rate under any shear force applied to them. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid)		Material 			https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/fluid
Gaseous material	Material composed of one or more chemical entities that has neither independent shape nor volume but tends to expand indefinitely (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000797). Infer that the sample is curated in some kind of container.		Fluid material			https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/gas
Liquid water	A material primarily composed of dihydrogen oxide in its liquid form; infer that the sample is curated in some kind of container.		Fluid material			https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/liquidwater
Material 	Top Concept in iSamples Material Category scheme					https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/material
Mineral 	Material consists of a single mineral or mineraloid phase.  A mineral is an element or chemical compound that is normally crystalline and that has been formed as a result of geological processes. (Nickel, Ernest H. (1995), The definition of a mineral, The Canadian Mineralogist. 33 (3): 689–90). Include mineraloids. ... A material primarily composed of some substance that is naturally occurring, solid and stable at room temperature, representable by a chemical formula, usually abiogenic, and that has an ordered atomic structure. (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000256). The identity of a mineral species is defined by a crystal structure and a chemical composition that might include various specific elemental substitutions in that structure. Mineraloid: A naturally occurring mineral-like substance that does not demonstrate crystallinity. Mineraloids possess chemical compositions that vary beyond the generally accepted ranges for specific minerals. Examples: obsidian, Opal. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineraloid)		Natural Solid Material			https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/mineral
Mixed soil sediment or rock	Material is mixed aggregation of fragments of undifferentiated soil, sediment or rock origin. e.g. cuttings from some boreholes (rock fragments and caved soil or sediment).	This class is for samples that are solid Earth materials but known not to be mineral or particulate samples.	Natural Solid Material			https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/mixedsoilsedimentrock
Non-aqueous liquid material 	Liquid composed dominantly of material other than water. Includes liquids that do not fit in any other category. E.g. alcohol, petroleum.		Fluid material		Fluids like blood, urine, mucus are problematic. Suggest categorizing as Non-aqueous liquid material and Organic material. Need example use cases.	https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/nonaqueousliquid
Organic material	Material derived from living organisms and composed primarily of one or more very large molecules of biological origin. Examples: body (animal or plant), body part, fecal matter, seeds, wood, tissue, biological fluids, biological waste, algal material, biofilm, necromass, plankton. source: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000155		Material 		Distinction from Biogenic non-organic material is fuzzy. Biogenic non-organic material is intended to cover biogenic products consisting of mineral or mineraloid substance, e.g. apatite (or other Ca phosphates), aragonite (or other Ca carbonate) typical of shells, bone, teeth.	https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/organicmaterial
Other anthropogenic material	Non-metallic material produced by human activity. Organic products of agricultural activity are both anthropogenic and organic. Include lab preparations like XRF pellet and rock powders. Examples: ceramics, concrete, slag, (anthropogenic) glass, mine tailing, plaster, waste.		Anthropogenic material			https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/otheranthropogenicmaterial
Particulate	Material consists of microscopic particulate material derived by precipitation, filtering, or settling from suspension in a fluid, e.g. filtrate from water, deposition from atmosphere, astro material particles. Might include mineral, organic, or biological material. ENVO definition (ENVO_01000060) has composed of microscopic portions of solid or liquid material suspended in another environmental material. Refine here to define as the solid particles, distinct from a material in which they are suspended. A material that includes solid or liquid particles suspended in another material would be a dispersed_media in this scheme, not defined in ENVO. Human manufactured particulates (e.g. rock powder) should be categorized as Anthropogenic material as well as Particulate		Natural Solid Material			https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/particulate
Rock	Consolidated aggregate of particles (grains) of rock, mineral (including native elements), mineraloid, or solid organic material. Includes mineral aggregates such as granite, shale, marble; natural glass such as obsidian; organic material formed by geologic processes such a coal;  extraterrestrial material in meteorites; and  crushed rock fragments like drill cuttings from rock.  (based on http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/rock, same as http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00001995)		Rock or sediment			https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/rock
Rock or sediment	Material is rock or sediment.  For example core from boreholes that likely penetrate sediment near the surface and rock at greater depth, with descriptions that do not clearly distinguish non-consolidated sediment from rock.	"Use for samples described as rock>sedimentary AND sediment, where it is unclear whether the sample is a consolidated rock object, or loose disaggregated material in a bag.	Use for samples like dredge hauls and ROV scoops that mix rock and sediment from a water body bottom."	Natural Solid Material		Distinct from Mixed soil, sediment or rock that represents samples known to have components of all these materials.	https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/rockorsediment
Sediment	Solid granular material transported by wind, water, or gravity, not modified by interaction with biosphere or atmosphere (to differentiate from soil). Particles might be derived by erosion of pre-existing rock, from shell or other body parts from organisms, precipitated chemically in the surficial environment, or generated by explosive volcanic activity. (http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/sediment). Sediment is not consolidated, i.e. the particulate constituents do not adhere to each other strongly enough that the aggregate can be considered a solid material in its own right. Similar to http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00002007	"Note that this category includes chemical sediments that might preciptate to form a solid mass, e.g. preciptitates forming vents at submarine hot springs, or gypsum and halite deposites formed by evaporation in hypersaline lakes. (http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/consolidationdegree/consolidated).	Tephra is subclass of sediment because it is generally not lithified, in which case it would be considered Rock."	Rock or sediment			https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/sediment
Soil	Mixed granular mineral and organic matter modified by interaction between earth material, biosphere, and atmosphere, consisting of varying proportions of sand, silt, and clay, organic material such as humus, gases, liquids, and a broad range of resident micro- and macroorganisms. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil) Soil consists of horizons near the Earths surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time.
