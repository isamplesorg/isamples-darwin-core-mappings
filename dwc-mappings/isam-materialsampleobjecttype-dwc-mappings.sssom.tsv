Examples: loose soil, sediment, crushed rock,  particulate, bunches of unrelated pot sherd, human production waste, filtrates and residues. The sample requires some kind of container to keep it together. Cores of loosely consolidated material are considered Solid material specimen when preserved such that the internal parts have spatial relationships (e.g. upper part, lower part, sedimentary structures).	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/materialsampleobjecttype/1.0/conceptscheme

An organism or organism part becomes a fossil when it has undergone some fossilization process that entails physical and chemical changes akin to diagenesis in a sedimentary rock. Includes trace fossils, which are manifestations of biologic activity preserved in a rock body (typically sedimentary), without included preserved body parts.	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/materialsampleobjecttype/1.0/conceptscheme
