isam:GeospatialCoordLocation	GeospatialCoordLocation	skos:broadMatch	dwc:Location	rdfs class	rdfs class	semapv:ManualMappingCuration		A physical location in decimal degrees using EPSG\:4326. Could be sample point location, or the centroid of a sampling area. Elevation is specified as a string that should include the measure, units of measure, and the vertical reference system, e.g. 'above mean sea level', 'below ground surface', 'below sea floor'...	A spatial region or named place.
isam:MaterialSampleCuration	MaterialSampleCuration	skos:relatedMatch	dwc:MaterialEntity	rdfs class	rdfs class	semapv:ManualMappingCuration	The term is defined at the most general level to admit descriptions of any subtype of material entity within the scope of Darwin Core. In particular, any kind of material sample, preserved specimen, fossil, or exemplar from living collections is intended to be subsumed under this term. Mapping is based on shared properties between the two classes	Information about the current storage of sample, access to sample, and events in curation history. Curation as used here starts when the sample is removed from its original context, and might include various processing steps for preservation. Processing related to analysis preparation such as crushing, dissolution, evaporation, filtering are considered part of the sampling method for the derived child sample.	An entity that can be identified, exists for some period of time, and consists in whole or in part of physical matter while it exists.
isam:MaterialSampleRecord	MaterialSampleRecord	skos:relatedMatch	dwc:Occurrence	rdfs class	rdfs class	semapv:ManualMappingCuration		This is a data object that is a digital representation of a material sample, and thus shares the same identifier as the physical object. It provides descriptive properties for any iSamples material sample, URI for the metadata record is same as URI for material sample-- digital object is considered twin of physical object, a representation. IGSN is recommended. Must be a URI that can be dereferenced on the web.	An existence of a dwc:Organism at a particular place at a particular time.
isam:MaterialSampleRecord	MaterialSampleRecord	skos:relatedMatch	dwc:MaterialEntity	rdfs class	rdfs class	semapv:ManualMappingCuration		This is a data object that is a digital representation of a material sample, and thus shares the same identifier as the physical object. It provides descriptive properties for any iSamples material sample, URI for the metadata record is same as URI for material sample-- digital object is considered twin of physical object, a representation. IGSN is recommended. Must be a URI that can be dereferenced on the web.	An entity that can be identified, exists for some period of time, and consists in whole or in part of physical matter while it exists.
isam:MaterialSampleRecord	MaterialSampleRecord	skos:closeMatch	dwc:MaterialSample	rdfs class	rdfs class	semapv:ManualMappingCuration		This is a data object that is a digital representation of a material sample, and thus shares the same identifier as the physical object. It provides descriptive properties for any iSamples material sample, URI for the metadata record is same as URI for material sample-- digital object is considered twin of physical object, a representation. IGSN is recommended. Must be a URI that can be dereferenced on the web.	A material entity that represents an entity of interest in whole or in part.
isam:SampleRelation	SampleRelation	skos:closeMatch	dwc:ResourceRelationship	rdfs class	rdfs class	semapv:ManualMappingCuration		Semantic link to other samples or related resources.	A relationship of one rdfs:Resource (http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Resource) to another.
isam:SamplingEvent	SamplingEvent	skos:relatedMatch	dwc:Event	rdfs class	rdfs class	semapv:ManualMappingCuration		Information about the event resulting in the creation of the material sample. Include information about permitting in the authorized_by property. The sampling procedure should be described in the description. If any special protocols were followed in the sampling procedure, they should be documented using the MaterialSampleRecord/complies_with property.	An action that occurs at some location during some time.
isam:SamplingSite	SamplingSite	skos:broadMatch	dwc:Location	rdfs class	rdfs class	semapv:ManualMappingCuration		Documentation of the site where the sample was collected, wtih place name(s) and a geospatial location.	A spatial region or named place.
isam:MaterialSampleRecord	MaterialSampleRecord	skos:closeMatch	Record-level	rdfs class		semapv:ManualMappingCuration	Record-level is not a rdfs:Class in Darwin Core, although it is treated as one. Therefore, object_type is left blank and the object_id does not include the namespace prefix. Record-level is a category used to group terms that specifically describe the entire dataset or individual record	This is a data object that is a digital representation of a material sample, and thus shares the same identifier as the physical object. It provides descriptive properties for any iSamples material sample, URI for the metadata record is same as URI for material sample-- digital object is considered twin of physical object, a representation. IGSN is recommended. Must be a URI that can be dereferenced on the web.	This category contains terms that are generic in that they might apply to any type of record in a dataset.
